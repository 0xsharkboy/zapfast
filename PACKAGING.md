# Packaging

[`native-packages.yaml`](native-packages.yaml) is the packaging configuration:
it pins the shared CLI and nFPM versions and declares Linux amd64/arm64 inputs,
DEB/RPM contents, dependencies, recipe templates and downstream repositories.
Application assets and native recipes stay in `packaging/`.

The next release uses the ZapFast name and `zapfast` binary. Its AUR recipes
provide and replace the corresponding FastsApp packages. The GitHub repository is
`crmne/zapfast`, so source archives extract into `zapfast-VERSION`. These
renamed templates target the next release; use the configuration from the matching tag to rebuild an older FastsApp release.
After publishing the first ZapFast release and AUR packages, update the README's
installation instructions and the site's `release_asset_prefix` and
`release_app_name` alongside its version. Existing release files keep their names.

```sh
gem install native-packages --version 0.5.1
native-packages validate
native-packages doctor
native-packages build --release v1.2.3
```

Replace `v1.2.3` with an existing stable application release. Local use also
requires nFPM 2.47.0, `bsdtar` and `readelf`; AUR generation needs `makepkg`
or Docker. CI installs its tooling. To package local release archives, put
every configured input and recipe asset under `dist/`, then run
`native-packages build --version 1.2.3`. Outputs go to
`dist/packages/1.2.3`; use `--output` for a fresh destination when rebuilding.

Stable tags run the existing native build jobs first. After binaries and
`checksums.txt` are published, the shared workflow verifies their hashes,
builds the configured packages, and attaches them to the GitHub release.
Configured recipes are attached as an archive. Package checksums are separate
from the original binary checksums. PR validation never publishes.

Review or publish an existing build with the same installed CLI:

```sh
native-packages publish --from dist/packages/1.2.3 --to github
native-packages repositories
native-packages status --offline
```

For applications with configured AUR or Homebrew destinations, stage the
recipes with `native-packages stage TARGET dist/packages/1.2.3/recipes`,
inspect `native-packages diff TARGET`, run native package validation, and
publish with `native-packages publish TARGET`. These destinations use ignored
managed Git clones, recorded in this application's YAML configuration.
AUR automation needs `PUBLISH_AUR=true`, `AUR_SSH_KEY` and `AUR_KNOWN_HOSTS`;
Homebrew automation needs `PUBLISH_HOMEBREW=true` and
`HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN`. Enable only configured destinations.

The native macOS configuration, Windows and Flatpak build steps remain responsible
for their native artifacts. Additional nFPM formats require suitable platform
inputs and dependencies; adding a format does not port the application.
See the [shared CLI documentation](https://github.com/crmne/native-packages/tree/v0.5.1)
for commands and supported formats.

To upgrade the tool, change `tool.version` in both `native-packages.yaml` and
`native-packages.macos.yaml`, the matching immutable workflow reference, and any release-job gem installation
pin together. Applications need no packaging Gemfile, lockfile or Ruby wrapper.

## Automatic macOS notarization

The macOS release job builds the app first, then uses
`native-packages.macos.yaml` and `packaging/macos/dmg.rb` to package it.
The shared gem signs its owned input copy, notarizes the DMG, staples and validates
Apple's ticket, and only then records final checksums. Configure these repository
secrets, which the job exposes as environment variables:

- `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12`: base64 PKCS#12 Developer ID Application certificate and private key.
- `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`: the export password.
- `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`: exact `Developer ID Application: Name (TEAMID)` identity.
- `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD`: Apple email, Team ID and app-specific password.

A complete set enables notarization automatically. An incomplete set fails;
no values retain local builds without Developer ID signing. Application inputs
and the user's normal keychains remain unchanged. See the shared
[Apple setup and phase contract](https://github.com/crmne/native-packages/blob/v0.5.1/docs/apple-notarization.md).

After preparing `dist/macos-input` on a Mac, test packaging without publishing:

```sh
native-packages --config native-packages.macos.yaml build \
  --version 1.2.3 --target macos-universal --output dist/macos-packages-test
```

Secret configuration applies to future builds. Existing published DMGs retain
their original signatures; this setup does not replace release assets.
